# Decentralized Finance or DeFi

## What is DeFi?

[Decentralized finance](https://chain.link/education/defi) or `DeFi` refers to the emerging blockchain-based ecosystem of permissionless and transparent financial services.

In the DeFi economy, users can access a similar financial application stack as they would in traditional finance but without requiring the involvement of centralized intermediaries. By using open-source protocols running on censorship-resistant and decentralized networks, DeFi applications provide global permissionless access, mitigate counterparty risk, and interoperate with other applications to enable more advanced financial products.

[Permissionless composability](https://chain.link/education-hub/permissionless-composability) is the design principle that is the key differentiating property between Defi and TradFi infrastructure.

- Permissionless composability in DeFi means developers can access key Web3 infrastructure without permission.

In a DeFi system:

- Users have greater confidence that their financial agreements will execute exactly as programmed (as the code is available for anyone to audit).
- Reduces development and compliance costs for developers
- Creates economic bridges, connecting what would otherwise be distinct economic segments and fostering growth.

### Stablecoins

The `sc` in the project name stands for `Stablecoins`. [Stablecoins](https://chain.link/education-hub/stablecoins) are a core DeFi component that allows fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and other assets to be represented on the blockchain as digital tokens.

### Exchanges and Markets

As we try and understand DeFi, it is essential to understand the importance of `decentralized exchanges`, `money markets`, `synthetic assets`, and `yield farming`. To learn about them read [here](exchangesandmarkets.md).
